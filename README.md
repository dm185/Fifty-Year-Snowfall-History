# Fifty-Year Snowfall History
-----------------------------------------------
## By Donnelly Miller

## Two Datasets
--------------------------------------------------
Two Excel files, one Excel file being for snowfall data for the Mount Baker Ski Area, and the second Excel file for snowfall data at Paradise at Mount Rainier. These two files then changed to CSV files for upload into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. The snowfall data consisted of measurements from the early 70s un up to the current season which due to pandemic has not been updated thus far.

## Project Motivation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skiers and snowboarders live for those big powder days. When it comes to which area has the largest annual snowfall in the state if not the world, Mount Baker Ski Area seems to be known as a deep snow paradise.
I wanted to do a comparison of the two different locations to see if the Mount Baker Ski area gets more annual snowfall or Paradise at Mount Rainier National park. Creating some visualizations using Matplotlib, one can see how the two areas compare in annual snowfall for past 50 seasons including the current season. One could potentially use this data to make predictions of when the next low or high snowfall year will occur. Such information could possibly be useful if a ski area plans to do expansion projects in anticipation of a snowy winter or if an area is better off focusing on their summer activities. 

## Summary of Findings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annual snowfall trends for both locations indicate fluctuations of upward and downward trends. The overall general trend is a decrease from the snowfall totals seen in the early to middle 1970s to the present year. With these upward and downward trends, upward trends have appeared to result in subsequent peaks indicating lesser peak annual snowfall amounts. When considering the annual snowfall trends from around 1979 to 1980, the general trend seems to be a slight increase to present day. Both locations have similar annual snowfall trend patterns.
